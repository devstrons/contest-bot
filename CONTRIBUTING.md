# âš¡ Contributing guidelines

We're glad you want to contribute to the **DEVSTRONS' Contest Discord bot** project!\
Below, we have some basic guidelines when contributing to our Discord bot project.

## âš’ Getting started

1. Fork this project
2. Clone the forked project with Git in your preferred directory

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/contest-bot.git
```

3. After making your changes

```bash
$ git add .
```

4. Make a commit according to our [**Commit guidelines**](#ðŸ“š-commit-guidelines)

You're done! **You have done your first pull request in our project!** ðŸš€
Now, you just have to wait until maintainers review your pull request.

## ðŸ“š Commit guidelines

- Separate your changes with commits.
- This also includes a list of examples of how we should use commit messages.

1. Commit 1: fix: vulnerability in v0.3.2 version
2. Commit 2: chore: repair GitHub workflow not working
3. Commit 3: feat: add proper code template
4. Commit 4: docs: improve the documentation on setting up Discord.js

- **Do not squash all commits into one unless requested by administrators.**

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "feat: Improve the `README.md` file"
```

- If your changes do multiple stuff (e.g.: feat and fix), use

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "[feat/fix]: Improve the `README.md` file and..." -m "fix some typos and errors.";
```

Common prefixes:

- fix: A bug fix
- feat: A new feature
- docs: Documentation changes
- test: Correct existing tests or add new ones

## âš™ Fixing a reported issue

Depending on what the issue is about, you can make a pull request to fix a reported issue.\
You must follow the same steps above, but first, please make sure your changes work properly.

## ðŸ‘€ Are you experiencing a bug?

If you are experiencing a bug with this bot, make sure you report it in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/devstrons/contest-bot/issues) or join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SNNTC7ZKGz) and tell our staff about it.

Make sure you

- Provide as much as possible information about the bug.
- Why do you think it's a bug? Please explain.
- What are you experiencing and why?
- Before reporting, make sure it's not been reported yet, mostly if it's a common issue.
- Try to be as clear in your answers and information, so the developers can fix it easier.
